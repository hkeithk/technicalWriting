Specifically, many pages converge to their true PageRank quickly, while relatively few pages take a much longer time to converge.  Furthermore, we observe that these slow-converging pages are generally those pages with high PageRank.  We use this observation to devise a simple algorithm to speed up the computation of PageRank, in which the PageRank of pages that have converged are not recomputed at each iteration after convergence.  This algorithm, which we call Adaptive PageRank, speeds up the computation of PageRank by nearly 30\%.}

We show how to exploit this structure to speed up the computation of PageRank by a 3-stage algorithm whereby (1)~the local PageRanks of pages for each host are computed independently using the link structure of that host, (2)~these local PageRanks are then weighted by the ``importance'' of the corresponding host, and (3)~the standard PageRank algorithm is then run using as its starting vector the weighted aggregate of the local PageRanks.  Empirically, this algorithm speeds up the computation of PageRank by a factor of 2 in realistic scenarios.  Further, we develop a variant of this algorithm that efficiently computes many different ``personalized'' PageRanks, and a variant that efficiently recomputes PageRank after node updates. }

The original PageRank algorithm uses the Power Method to compute successive iterates that converge to the principal eigenvector of the Markov matrix representing the Web link graph.  The algorithm presented here, called Power Extrapolation, accelerates the convergence of the Power Method by subtracting off the error along several nonprincipal eigenvectors from the current iterate of the Power Method, making use of known nonprincipal eigenvalues of the Web hyperlink matrix. Empirically, we show that using Power Extrapolation speeds up PageRank computation by 30% on a Web graph of 80 million nodes in realistic scenarios over the standard power method, in a way that is simple to understand and implement. }
